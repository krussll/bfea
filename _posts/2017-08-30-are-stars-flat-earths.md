New research from BFEA member James Goff suggests that celestial stars could be other flat earths, with his findings opening up the possibility for a “Flat Earth System”.

His paper is based on several thought experiments and independent telescopic observations have opened up the idea that brightness of stars may not be caused by distance, but by angles of flat Earths.

“The idea is that stars can be the same distance from our own flat Earth, however some stars may be ‘facing’ us more than others, which in turn provides greater levels of light. The light emanating from them could also suggest other Flat Earth life forms” said Goss.

Further detail will be on Goss’ paper, which we are hopeful of appearing in the next issue of New Scientist, due to the exciting nature of the descovery, however we are still awaiting on a final decision.
