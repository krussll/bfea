# About BFEA
BFEA is a leading scientific and professional organization representing Flat Earth theory in the UK, with more than 1,000 researchers, consultants and students as supporters.

## Our Work

Our mission is to advance the knowledge of Flat Earth Theory (FET) to benefit society and improve people's lives. We do this by:
- Advising members to promote FET amongst their peer groups, and strangers alike
- Using thought experiments pioneered by String Theorists to push the boundaries of knowledge of FET
- Pressurising local and national government to fully accept the field of FET

## Our Leadership

BFEA is currently run by our committee. We have a strict democratised system to ensure we continue to be run by our full membership base.
