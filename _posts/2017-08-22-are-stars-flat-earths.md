New research from BFEA member James Goff suggests that celestial stars could be other flat earths, with his findings opening up the possiblity for a "Flat Earth System".

His paper is based on several thought experiments and teloscopic observations have opened up the idea that brightness of stars may not be caused by distance, but by angles of flat Earths.
