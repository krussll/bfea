title: What is the Flat Earth Theory?
---

Flat Earth Theory (FET) is the theory that the Earth is flat and that Round Earth doctrine is a hoax. The theory is based on the 1884 work of Samuel Birley Rowbotham, his system held that the earth is a flat disk centered at the North Pole and bounded along its southern edge by a wall of ice, with the sun, moon, planets, and stars only a few hundred miles above the surface of the earth. Thanks to the hard work of enlightened researchers we have been able to expand on this to produce the current FET.
